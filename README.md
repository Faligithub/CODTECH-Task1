### Technology Used
- **Power BI**: Power BI is a tool from Microsoft that helps us see and understand data. It allows us to create interactive charts and reports, making it easy to spot trends and insights. We can connect it to different data sources, transform that data, and share our findings with others. Power BI is user-friendly, so both tech-savvy and non-technical people can use it to make better decisions based on data.
